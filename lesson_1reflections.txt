How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it showed the places where there were differences in the two files so 
    attention could be focused on less text.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    version control

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you chose when you are finished
    create thoughtful end points
    might not commit often enough
    You can control one logical change per commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    multiple files allows for different versions for different operating systems
    files are often inter-related (html css) and changes need to be tracked together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the different commits. then git diff shows the changes btwn
    two commit ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git makes it simple to revert to a prior state.
    it can point out what lines of code where changed 
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control of programs and this class
