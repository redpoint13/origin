	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Sharing work with others
    working from multiple computers
    back ups
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Assure that public commits work properly
	Control freature releases
	More desisive

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
	A fork is a clone on github
	clones are exact copies of a repo
	branches copies of the master with changes like adding expermintal features

When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are only used on github when you don't have permission to colloarate
	Use clone any time you'd like an exact copy for like multiple computers
	branches are used make changes that are not reflected in the master branch.  They can later be merged but may always be different.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	changes can be merged
	you know what the status of the files are
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 
	email, in person, google docs

What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	having only one set of files could be easiser be slower

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
	branching should be done when testing an idea or making changes that are not simple bug fixes

What benefits does each approach have?
	making changes directly in master makes the easily available
	branching allows testing of changes and colloaboration
