Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a clone on github
	clones are exact copies of a repo
	branches copies of the master with changes like adding expermintal features

	Forks are only used on github when you don't have permission to colloarate
	Use clone any time you'd like an exact copy for like multiple computers
	branches are used make changes that are not reflected in the master branch.  They can later be merged but may always be different.
